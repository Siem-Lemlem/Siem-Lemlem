## Hi, I'm Siem Lemlem

I'm a full-stack developer and software engineer with a focus on building thoughtful, efficient, and user-focused experiences. I enjoy working across the stack — from design-driven frontend work to systems and AI projects that push how things are built and used.

I'm currently freelancing and developing a few long-term projects, including:
- **404Dashboard** – an open-source resource manager  
- **AI projects** – three experimental models under active development  
- **Rust-based OS** – a learning-driven operating system project  
- **Version control system** – a lightweight tool built from scratch  

### Tech Stack
**Languages:** Rust, TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, CSS  
**Frameworks & Tools:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Motion, GSAP, Lenis  

### What I Care About
I value simplicity in both design and architecture. My work aims to make interfaces intuitive, codebases maintainable, and experiences feel effortless.
